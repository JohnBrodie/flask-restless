"""Helper functions for unit tests in this package.

New test classes should probably inherit from one of the existing ones
here. These classes add ``getj``, ``postj``, etc. methods to the test client
(available at ``self.app``) which for the content type of the requests to
:mimetype:`application/json`. When writing new tests, use these so that you
don't have to add ``content_type='application/json'`` every time you make a
request.
